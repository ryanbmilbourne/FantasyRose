A fantasy-football like game for The Bachelor

**This repo is in active development.  Issue #1 is a task list outlining what I am working on to get to the inital milestone.  I am new to milestone tracking so I could very well end up using some anti-patterns.  Comments are always helpful.**

## About 
Each week players bid on contestants to form their team.  Contestants are awarded or docked points based on the stuff they do and stuff done to them.  We call these `events`.  A player gets a total of $10,000 for the season to bid on players.  

The backend is nodejs, I am using handlebars as a templating engine, and the front-end is using Bootstrap.  
The collections are stored in Orhcestrate.  I am using Passport for user auth, which stores the user information (salted passwords) in a collection in Orchestrate.
